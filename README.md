# My notes
React is a framework using it. I can build complex web Application like hotStar.
React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

.jsx(file) gives me facility to write html + javascript together
    Inside curly braces, write your variable name.
    Using props, we pass value from parent to child using variable as props.

How we manage state and handle click :
I want as book ticket button clicked by someone, increase total booking count dynamically
we use useState hook to manage state
useState holds the data temporarily but not permanently

# How we can render list of movies(1000) from backend in UI using map function

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
